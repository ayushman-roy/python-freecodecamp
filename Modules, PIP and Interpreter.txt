Module - Any External file Imported to the current .py file, to use in the program, which contains pre-written code.
Modules can be download from the internet as well as be written ourselves.
Go to python docs to find useful modules.
You can also use 3rd party Modules.

EXAMPLE -
let usefulTools.py be a python file which has code and functions in it.
In order to access the code and functions from it simply, type :
        import usefulTools
In your current .py project at the very start.
Access the functions and code by:
        print(usefulTools.xyz())

Pre-Installed External Modules Access -
usually, to access them -
External Libraries/ Python 3.8/ Lib/ xmlrpc
Or just do a quick google search.



PIP - Installer for Modules.
Package Manager.
To install packages, usually -
Go to Directory where pip is located using CMD
Type the following in the terminal :
        pip install {package name}
To uninstall modules :
        pip uninstall {package name}

The External file will usually be downloaded in the -
External Libraries/ Python 3.8/ Lib/ site-packages



Interpreter - usually, the Terminal or CMD where we can test out python code before using them in our programs.
A sandbox environment, a quick way to test code.
To use interpreter -
Go to CMD and the directory of python app and type:
            python3
If an error occurs it is usually because the command is not registered in the path variable.
Just do a google search on how to add the path variable.
Similar issues may be faced in case of pip as well.
