# Python - FreeCodeCamp
Python project made by following the YouTube tutorial by freecodecamp (https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw). \
This project was my first interaction with programming. I learned concepts like loops, if-else statements and OOP. \
Essentially a basic python project to understand the the syntax and feel of the language.
